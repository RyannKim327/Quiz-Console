### Some guides
> I use base64 to encrypt the data, so that a normal user may not answer the question, by just looking to the list file. If you want to look for it, [just visit this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-python/). I use enc.py to encrypt the questions, as well as the answers, very quick and easy. To terminate the program, just use CTRL + C on your keyboard.
