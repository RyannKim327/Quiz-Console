### How to use (Console)
> Just download this source by using git clone or download as archieve file thru desktop or browser's desktop mode. Then execute this code thru your console.
```Bash
python index.py
```

### How to use (GUI)
> First is you need to install the tkinter mentioned above, and then your device must support GUI for python, if you're using mobile phone, I highly recommened to you to use PyDroid 3 or replit for online compiller. Same process with the console, but this is the code you need to use.
```Bash
python indexgui.py

### Some guides
> I use base64 to encrypt the data, so that a normal user may not answer the question, by just looking to the list file. If you want to look for it, [just visit this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-python/). I use enc.py to encrypt the questions, as well as the answers, very quick and easy. To terminate the program, just use CTRL + C on your keyboard.
